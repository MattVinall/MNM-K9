                <h3>Tyler</h3>
                <p>Tyler Melnike is the owner and head trainer of MNM K9. With over six years of experience in the dog industry, he is able to work with a variety of dogs and diagnose and treat any issues they may have. Growing up in a family that always had a dog, Tyler knew from a young age that he wanted to work with animals when he grew up. Tyler has raised and trained all four of his Siberian Huskies that he currently owns. When he is not busy working with dogs or helping clients, Tyler enjoys spending his time going for trail rides and hikes with his pack and reading up on new training methods.    </p>

                <h3>Mukka</h3>
                <p>Mukka was the pup that started it all for MNM K9. He had the highest level of training out of our pack, and was trained in advanced obedience, advanced agility, search and rescue, film work, and service work. Mukka fathered our first litter with Nymeria. He loved every dog and human he met and was always ready to greet you upon your arrival to our home. Unfortunately, Mukka passed away in April 2019. We thank him for everything he taught us. </p>
